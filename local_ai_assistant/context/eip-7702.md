EIP-7702 is an Ethereum Improvement Proposal that introduces a new transaction type allowing standard user accounts (EOAs) to temporarily act as smart contracts. This enables EOAs to gain functionalities like transaction batching and gas sponsorship without needing to migrate to a new address. The new transaction type allows an EOA to delegate execution to a specific smart contract for the duration of a single transaction, bridging the gap between basic EOAs and more complex smart contract wallets.
